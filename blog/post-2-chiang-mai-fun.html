There are hilariously worded (seriously, has no one heard of google translate?) posters for adventures - elephant riding, rafting, visiting hill-tribes, zip-lining, and hiking - posted all around the city. Many hostels, including Julie's, will not let you stay more than a few days unless you book a trek through them, because they generally earn a few hundred baht from the mark-up. We really liked Julie's, and I really wanted to go on a trek, so we decided to take the plunge.

            However, we didn't want to stay with hill-tribe people (something about paying people so you can blatantly stare at their 'culture' and does not sit well with me), and we did not want to ride elephants (training elephants consists of chaining them up and poking them with sticks for days until their spirits break, and riding elephants is also terrible for their backs). So we opted to go on a four hour hike that included swimming in a waterfall. We wanted to do this on our own, but figuring out how to get to a good area with no car and no good online directions was too difficult. $1200 baht ($40) per person was a lot, but it turned out to be totally worth it.
