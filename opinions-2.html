		<h4> The Environment
		</h4>
		<p> 
		The way I see it, the great and beautiful potential of the human race is to live on. "Forever", whatever that means, is likely impossible. Millions of years is not impossible. We have seven billion people on our planet. And each person is beautiful and valuable and worth something. Each person will live out his or her life, however long it is - she or he will feel, touch, ponder, perhaps love, hate, cry, or laugh, and hopefully benefit others. And then, each person will die. <i>(Unless medicine goes crazy. See my immortaility section).</i> Seven billion people. It's difficult to imagine. But now, multiply all of those precious, unique lives, by a million. Seven million, billion people. Multiply it by a billion! Despite the enormous importance and beauty incapsulated by the current population of our species - our current population is a tiny, nearly insignificant portion of what humans could be. If each person is worth something, I think it's criminal to endanger the potential of so many people's lives by damaging our environment, and likely damaging the stability of our society over time.
		</p>
		<p>
We have the potential to move on to other planets, other solar systems. We have the potential to create so many more lives than the Earth sustains today. So many, that our current population - more than a twentieth of the entire human race's progeny (!) - is made almost insignificant.
		</p>
		<p>
Who says that one person alive now has so much more of a right to live that a person who will be living next year? What about one person now to ten people in a year? In ten years? Trillions upon trillions of people? Over many, many years? Did a person born ten years before yourself have more of a right to live than you? I don't think so. I value the intrinsic goodness of having one more person live out and enjoy his or her life. Wherever, whenever that person may live. Which brings me to the point of this piece. The environment.
		</p>
		<p>
I love nature. My heart feels the fullest when I'm staring out into a dark, wet forest, teeming with life. But the reason I am so vehemently opposed to shortsightedly squandering Earths resources on short term gains (even 50 year short term gains), is because it may endanger our species' long term survival.
		</p>
		<p>
Global warming, overfishing, overpollution, and collapsing ecosystems engender human suffering and strife. They are clearly the effects of market errors that haven't been corrected because humans truly suck at coming together for the greater good (we are great at coming together for the individual's good). Environmental woes eventually cause economic and political strife. And if that strife, if those environmental problems have even a .1% chance of causing strife that will decrease the chances of the human race launching its genes out towards the stars, then we need to be careful. Because the expected loss is unimaginably enormous. Unless you truly believe each person born one hundred years ago was intrinsicly worth much more than you are. Discounting, anyone?
		</p>
		<p>
I think we're being irrisponsibly selfish. I think we need to slow down our population growth, slow down our production lines, and slow down our environmental degredation to get a bearning on what the hell the human race wants to do with itself. We need to put for effort into trying to be peaceful, into educating the poor, into making sure a flu doesn't randomly wipe out most of us. We need to eat less meat and invest in technology. Because a huge war, or a huge epidemic, or both, might not wipe out the entire human race. But it surely will decrease our technological capacity. And our probability of expanding out towards the stars.

		<h4> Good Media?
		</h4>	
		<p>
I loved Arrested Development. Game of Thrones has been really fun to watch with friends. My favorite movie of all time, I beleive, is Tropic Thunder. Great, great stuff.

		<h4> Feminism?
		</h4>
		<p> 
Racism seems pretty much plain stupid. So I'm convinced that we can eventually fix it. But feminism concerns me, because even if we fix all of the societal shit that is an effect, mostly, of historical tendencies, there's still a problem: men and women are clearly biolgially different. We're <i>not</i> equal. I can't say which one is smarter or better, but it is quite clear that certain sexes on <i>average</i> excell at tasks differently. But that isn't even the worrisome problem. The worrisome problem, is that women seem to be biologically more devoted than men to caring for children. Which is why it can make <i> sense </i> for an employer to hire a man over a women! Which is why it can make <i>sense</i> for a woman to make less money than a man, because she'll spend more time caring for her children. Will women ever (again, on average, people) be able to make it as far in the workplace, in society, if the money is so connected to non-child-rearing activities? I don't have answers, or suggestions here. Only that it's not the biggest concern in the world, and anyways, women have a ways to go before we have to worry to much about the actual (average) biological glass ceiling. For the present, we can focus on unjustified sexism.
		</p>
                <p>
I think there are more important issues in the world (environmental protection, deterring wars, education), but I do think that women have it tough. And it's not just the whole 'employers will chose resumes more often if the name at the top is male', thing. Its the fact that - generally speaking - men are the rapists, men are the murderers, and women are the ones that often have to fear going out at night, or endure wolfwhistes and grabs, objectifying looks, comments that make her feel like a walking fucktoy, whose value and weakness is encompassed by her beauty. Women are the ones, at least in the past, where the ones to get married, have babies, and trust that her husband would keep a job, not divorce her.
                </p>
                <p>
Obviously, this is not the whole story. Men get raped (although, usually by other men). Men get objectified. And men have to endure society's expectation that they will act 'manly'. And it's also true that women have a power in their beauty. But I think that it's still comparing a rock to a boulder. Which sex is the one that has more to fear every single 
                </p>
		<p>
P.S. It's not a given that men are as smart as women, or that women are as smart as men, on average. It's a touchy subject, so people just take the "of course we're equal!!" standpoint. But it's not actually a given. Wish it were.

		<h4> Democracy
		</h4>	
		<p>
		Yeah, it's beautiful. But, it has its problems. Big problems.
<li> There's too much information for each person to deal with. We can't all read the 1309 page bills on, you know, cauldren thickness and whatnot. And so instead we pick some old white guy who looks reasonable and curries to the median voter to decide on those things. Well, that's not perfect either. And it's also not democracy.</li>
<li> People are stupid. Sorry, but we are. It scares me sometimes. </li>
<li> Democracy is slow. In some ways, this is good, because it is more or less stable. But it also means we're immobilized by our democratic sluggishness and layman ignorance and selfishness. It's a problem. </li>
<li> But... I don't have a solution. You know, save a supercomputer that helps us all. So, on with voting for dear old Barack. Oh, I guess he isn't all white, and not too old. Yay. Still. </li>

		<h4> The Value of Intelligence in a Human.
		</h4>
		<p> It's good for society, but should we allow ourselves to truly judge a person's intrinsic (not just societal) value based off of intelligence? We argue that it's okay to murder and eat the flesh of animals, because we are "smarter" and more "developed" than them. This, despite the fact that they are sentient, and some of them quite intelligent and socially complex (pigs are arguably smarter than dogs; they make better seeing eye helpers). If we can kill and feast on an intelligent, social pig because it's not as smart as (non-infant) humans, shouldn't you be able to value someone less for being dumber? It's a simple extension. 
		</p>
		<p>
I don't think we should be killing so many animals for food. It's bad for the environment. See my <i>meat</i> section.

		<h4> Let's Go Conquer some Planets
		</h4>
		<p> 
I'm just saying. The human race is worth a lot. What if we all blow up in a freak explosion or epidemic or fucking, I don't know, killer butterfly attack? I don't care. We should diversify. As T goes to infinity, you can't guarantee that we won't kill ourselves all off in some way, or that something won't kill us all off. But that risk would be cut down every time we inhabited a new planet. Don't put all your money in one basket. Diversify.

		<h4> Abortion
		</h4>
		<p>
I understand the whole murder thing. I even understand the crazies who think it's immoral to use condoms. Or ever stop having sex and babies, ever. But our world is overpopulated, and I'd rather have lots of happy babies living in the future, growing up in families who are ready and willing to love and teach them, than a few more babies now, growing up in homes that are not ideal, likely commandeering their parent(s)'s lives for the next so many years, and inhabiting a world that needs to get its shit together before it pops out some more unwanted babies. In the long run, legalizing abortion is better.
		</p>
		<p>
Abstinence, condoms, the day after pill, abortion, late term abortion, baby-killing. Most of us agree the stuff on the left is A-okay. Most of us agree that the stuff on the right is not okay at at all. I get that a line is crossed when two cells become one, because I suppose the potential for a specific life has increased. But from the zygote on out it's a blur. Any line that will ever be drawn, to me, will be an arbitrary, and yet for now, a neccessary one. Because I would not deprive a woman of her freedom or the future's children of hope for a few cells that could have a better life in a hundred years.
		</p>

		<h4> Immortality
		</h4>
		<p> 
We don't even know how infinity exists in the real world. But stopping the aging process, improving healing methods - that is not out of human reach. It entices me... I'm terrified of death. It haunts me, waking and sleeping. But a world with a live-on pill? The world would get over populated so rapidly that we'd collapse in on ourselves. Or, only rich people would get it. Which would make some people terrible desperate for money - truly a life or death situation: dangerous. Any way I parse it, it wouldn't be good for us, at least in the next few thousand years, while we are bounded by a single planet.

	<h4> Kids and Morality</h4>
		<p> 
Okay, sure. Kids can be cruel. But I also think we underestimate, and disrespect them more than we should. I think kids can be smarter, and more moral than many adults. In some ways, at least.
                </p>


	<p><center><bold> *** </bold></center></p>


	<h4> The Deficit</h4>
		<p> 
It's not true that the plurality of our national deficit is owed to China. Of all the countries we owe money, China has the largest claim. But this percentage is only about 8%. About two thirds of our debt, we owe to ourselves. Mostly, to old people. Medicare, Medicaid, pensions, Social Security. Basically, we said we'd pay people X or solve health problems Y, and now we're swimming in our shit, and headed towards the biggest part of the river. I feel that it would be unfair to deeply cut promised pensions.
</p>
<p>
 Despite the fact that we are in deep do-do, I think there are better low-hanging fruit to be picked. And those fruis are the benefits given out by Medicaid and Medicare. I think we should decrease the amount of money spent on old people in their last weeks of life. (Insert stats here...) I think it's silly to spend so much money on a last few days, weeks, or perhaps even months of life. It may be cruel, but it does seem logical to me - at least, it seems like the best of many not-so-great options.
</p>
<p>
 I would also argue to gradually decrease the massive subsidies (direct and indirect) given to agriculture and petroleum markets. They are ridiculous! Often, people overlook such subsidies, because instead of tax-pay-money being spent on direct subsdies, the story is a lack-of-tax-money from the agriculture and petroleum markets. But having less tax income from a particular group, and paying that group some money, are two very similar things. The effects are dependent upon the elasticity of supply and whatnot, but in general, these markets are being disgustingly subsidized by the government, but people don't notice because most of the subsidies are indirect.

		<h4> 
                  Health Insurance
		</h4>
		<p> 
                 Health insurance should not be linked to employment. The link is a silly relic from when nearly no one had insurance. Now, it just serves to hurt the recently unemployed even more by removing their health security at the same time their monetary security is removed. Basic and emergency (to an extent, i.e. have a cutoff limit) insurance should be given to everyone. But people should pay for the small things, as well as pay for their bad practices that increase their health risks. 
		</p>
                <p>
                Why give everyone basic emergency insurance? 1) Decreasing marginal returns to money (and consequent risk aversion) makes this a good thing for people. 2) For those people who couldn't, or more likely wouldn't pay for emergency insurance would end up either dying in hospitals for solvable reasons (bad), or making hospitals or governments unfairly pay for any of their emergency problems. Basic ensurance should be given so that people get a mole checked out before they go to the emergency room with metastisized cancer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Despite all of this, let's be real: I lived in Spain for a year. I saw how people went to the doctor for nearly no reason at all, because it was free and they could get some free days off of work if they were lucky. Being fat should either should be taxed, or people should be forced to pay more for health insurance. (Despite the whole moral who-ha about forcing people to buy stuff, it's equivalent to taxing them and then giving it away for free.)
